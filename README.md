### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rohan Kapur and I love building software powered tools and services. Here, you can find a collection of my work. Some complete and others in WIP status or abandoned entirely :( Feel free to snoop around. 

I'm currently actively working on Paymint - a Bitoin wallet for Android and iOS, although I do tend to work on smaller side projects apart from Paymint when I can.
